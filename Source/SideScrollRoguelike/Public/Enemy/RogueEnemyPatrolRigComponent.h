/*
 * This is an example of a component with default subobjects. It provides a way to have a component that creates and attaches
 * required components for its operation into its parent's hierarchy. They cannot be removed unless their parent (this component)
 * is removed.
 *
 * This is an all-in-one class to allow authoring a patrolling enemy in a single package.
 * It can be attached to an actor blueprint to allow placing in the scene, or attached to an existing actor instance
 * Since it uses a spline component (which is derived from a scene component), the patrol can be placed anywhere relative
 * to the actor parent, and if the actor parent moves, the patrol points will move with it.
